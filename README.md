# Technological-topography
A crowdsourced project that measures global network quality and routing paths, and transforms them into a new kind of technological topography. Users contribute latency, jitter, packet loss, and traceroute data to collectively build a map that reveals the hidden boundaries shaped by digital infrastructure.
